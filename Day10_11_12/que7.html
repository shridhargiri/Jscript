        <p>
            Hello,
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Shridhar Giri. I am a Computer Science graduate and I've completed B.E in the year 2019. Apart from B.E. i've done various courses such as Networking and system Administration, Red Hat Emterprise Linux Administration and Desktop Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was all about my academics. Along with the academics, I am also fond of playing basketball, but yes, I've a passion for weight lifting and body building.

        <p>
            If I was to mention my qualities, I'll only list the most important one, that is, I love to learn new things, either by self studying or under someone's guidence.
